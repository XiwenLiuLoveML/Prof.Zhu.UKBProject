# Prof.Zhu.UKBProject
This repository contains codes and data for the medical students of Prof. Zhu, who are on a project to build disease risk prediction models using machine learning techniques. 

The programming language used in this project is R. Since most the med students in the group have never learned R before, in the data preparation part I also included some teaching on basic knowledge about R.

The R markdown files here are for anyone who are new to R and machine learning.

## RcodeforUKB.pdf provides the basic code for R novice to load the data.
