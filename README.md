# Prof.Zhu.UKBProject
This repository contains codes and data for the medical students of Prof. Zhu, who are on a project to build disease risk prediction models using machine learning techniques. 

The data provided here is a sample data from the UK Biobank(UKB) data pool. We will first fit the model to this small amount of data, then move forward to use parallel or cloud computing to deal with the big data.

The programming language used in this project is R. Since most the med students in the group have never learned R before, in the data preparation part I also included some teaching on basic knowledge about R.

The R markdown files here are for anyone who are new to R and machine learning.

## RcodeforZhu.pdf provides the basic code for R novice to load the data.
